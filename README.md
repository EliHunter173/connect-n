# Connect-N

This project is a fork of a project at my university; I considered it interesting enough to copy it
over to my own personal account for further development.

I have done my best to make this project unsearchable to prevent plagiarism. Additionally, I have
added and changed so much that this project is now no longer within the bounds of the rubric.

## Features

* Connect Four style gameplay.
* An arbitrary, user-specified number of tokens to connect to win.
* A board of arbitrary dimensions.
* An arbitrary number of players.
* [AI](AI.md) with 5 different difficulty levels.
