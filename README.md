# Connect-N

For our comprehensive exercise, we chose to do Connect Four with a twist. Instead of the traditional two-player game where the goal is to always connect four tokens on a 7x6 board, we decided to make it so that the user can specify an arbitrary number of players, an arbitrary board size, and an arbitrary number of tokens to connect, with very few limits on their creativity.

We call this game, *Connect-N!*
